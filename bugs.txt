*Some pages in internet explorer seem to have elements with duplicated unique IDs, therefore creating an inifit depth page for NVDA to load. Usually this only cause an exception that doesn't seem to stuff things up too much.
*In rich edit controls and MS Word documents, sayAll seems to skip the last line if it is not blank.
*NVDA freezes during a sayAll in Wordpad if the current document is an rtf. 
*SayAll does not update the cursor position in Internet Explorer edit controls and Outlook Express message edit controls.
