Changes since 425:
*Fix bug where the wrong character was being announced when pressing delete in Internet Explorer / Outlook Express editable panes.
*Added support for more edit fields in Skype.
*Make loading of virtualBuffers a little more silent if focus is not directly with in the window where the virtualBuffer is situated.
*Added commandline arguments to NVDA:
-m, --minimal: do not play startup/exit sounds and do not show the interface on startup if set to do so.
-q, --quit: quit any other already running instance of NVDA and then exit
-s, --stderr-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place uncaught errors and exceptions
-d, --debug-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place debug messages
-c, --config-file: specify an alternative configuration file  
-h, -help: show a help message listing commandline arguments
 *Fixed bug where punctuation symbols would not be translated to the appropriate language, when using a language other than english, and when speak typed characters was turned on.
*Added Slovak language files thanks to Peter Vagner 
*Added a Virtual Buffer settings dialog and a Document Formatting settings dialog, from Peter Vagner.
*Added French translation thanks to Michel Such 
*Added a script to toggle beeping of progress bars on and off (insert+u). Contributed by Peter Vagner.
*Made more messages in NVDA be translatable for other languages. This includes script descriptions when in keyboard help.
*Added a find dialog to the virtualBuffers (internet Explorer and Firefox). Pressing control+f when on a page brings up a dialog in which you can type some text to find. Pressing enter will then search for this text and place the virtualBuffer cursor on this line. Pressing f3 will also search for the next occurance of the text.
*When speak typed characters is turned on, more characters should be now spoken. Technically, now ascii characters from 32 to 255 can now be spoken.
*Renamed some control types for better readability. Editable text is now edit, outline is now tree view and push button is now button.
*When arrowing around list items in a list, or tree view items in a tree view, the control type (list item, tree view item) is no longer spoken, to speed up navigation.
*Has Popup (to indicate that a menu has a submenu) is now spoken as submenu.
*Where some language use control and alt (or altGR) to enter a special character, NVDA now will speak these characters when speak typed characters is on.
*Fixed some problems with reviewing static text controls.
*Added Translation for Traditional Chinese, thanks to Coscell Kao.
*Re-structured an important part of the NVDA code, which should now fix many issues with NVDA's user interface (including settings dialogs).
*Added Sapi4 support to NVDA. Currently there are two sapi4 drivers, one based on code contributed by Serotek Corporation, and one using the ActiveVoice.ActiveVoice com Interface. Both these drivers have issues, see which one works best for you.
*Now when trying to run a new copy of NVDA while an older copy is still running will cause the new copy to just exit. This fixes a major problem where running multiple copies of NVDA makes your system very unusable.
*Renamed the title of the NVDA user interface from NVDA Interface to NVDA. 
*Fixed a bug in Outlook Express where pressing backspace at the start of an editable message would cause an error.
*Added patch from Rui Batista that adds a script to report the current battery status on laptops (insert+shift+b).
 *Added a synth driver called Silence. This is a synth driver that does not speak anything, allowing NVDA to stay completely silent at all times. Eventually this could be used along with Braille support, when we have it.
*Added capitalPitchChange setting for synthesizers thanks to J.J. Meddaugh
*Added patch from J.J. Meddaugh that makes the toggle report objects under mouse script more like the other toggle scripts (saying on/off rather than changing the whole statement).
*Added spanish translation (es) contributed by Juan C. buo.
*Added Hungarian language file from Tamas Gczy.
*Added Portuguese language file from Rui Batista.
*Changing the voice in the voice settings dialog now sets the rate, pitch and volume sliders to the new values according to the synthesizer, rather than forcing the synthesizer to be set to the old values. This fixes issues where a synth like eloquence or viavoice seems to speek at a much faster rate than all other synths.
*Fixed a bug where either speech would stop, or NVDA would entirely crash, when in a Dos console window.
*If support for a particular language exists, NVDA now automatically can show its interface and speak its messages in the language Windows is set to. A particular language can still be chosen manualy from the user interface settings dialog as well.
*Added script 'toggleReportDynamicContentChanges' (insert+5). This toggles whether new text, or other dynamic changes should be automatically announced. So far this only works in Dos Console Windows.
*Added script 'toggleCaretMovesReviewCursor' (insert+6). This toggles whether the review cursor should be automatically repositioned when the system caret moves. This is useful in Dos console windows when trying to read information as the screen is updating.
*Added script 'toggleFocusMovesNavigatorObject' (insert+7). This toggles whether the navigator object is repositioned on the object with focus as it changes.
*Added some documentation translated in to various languages. So far there is French, Spannish and Finish.
*Removed some developer documentation from the binary distribution of NVDA, it is only now in the source version.
*Fixed a possible bug in Windows Live Messanger and MSN Messenger where arrowing up and down the contact list would cause errors.
*New messages are now automatically spoken when in a conversation using Windows Live Messenger. (only works for English versions so far)
*The history window in a Windows Live Messenger conversation can now be read by using the arrow keys. (Only works for English versions so far) 
*Added script 'passNextKeyThrough' (insert+f2). Press this key, and then the next key pressed will be passed straight through to Windows. This is useful if you have to press a certain key in an application but NVDA uses that key for something else.
*NVDA no longer freezes up for more than a minute when opening very large documents in MS Word.
 *Fixed a bug where moving out of a table in MS Word, and then moving back in, caused the current row/column numbers not to be spoken if moving back in to exactly the same cell.

Changes since revision 380:
*Added German language translation thanks to Ali Savas <ali-savas@gmx.de>.
*Make the NVDA exit dialog act more like a standard warning dialog with icon and sound.
*NVDA now has its own icon, which appears in the top left corner of the NVDA interface window, and also now on the system tray.
*When the NVDA interface window is visible, it no longer has a taskbar icon, only a system tray icon. Pressing enter or double clicking on the system tray icon will bring up the NVDA interface window, just like insert+n.
*Outlook express: When arrowing through an attachment list for an email, NVDA no longer reports each one as being called attachment.
*Fixed some bugs in Mozilla application virtualBuffers where spaces were being inserted where they shouldn't be. Also some lines were still longer than the max line length configuration option.
*Fixed a bug where NVDA would not be able to be started from any directory but its own.
*Fixed bug where NVDA would not report the proper focus when in a menu, when pressing insert+upArrow
*Possibly fixed a bug where NVDA would sometimes crash when a dos console window gained focus.
*Fixed a bug where NVDA would report an error in keyboardHandler on startup.
*Added support for the edit fields in Skype's add contact wizard.
*Slightly improved cursor tracking and speaking of the right character when arrowing by character in some windows such as dos consoles.
 *A possible fix for the bug where opening dialogs in the preferences menu would cause NVDA to crash.
*Improved the speaking of script names and descriptions when in keyboard help mode (insert+1). Script names are now spoken with out the underlines, and the description is spoken before the location, rather than after.
*When changing the voice of a sapi5 synthesizer, NVDA now reloads sapi5 each time. This fixes a problem where some voices would sound aliased or scratchy.
*Improved performance when holding down arrow keys etc in edit fields and Word documents etc. Now NVDA only tries to speak the line or character if there is nothing else that has been already requested (i.e. it will only speak when finally letting go of the arrow keys).
*NVDA should now be able to be run on read-only file systems (such as CDs) and should have slightly better performance when running off a USB key. This is because NVDA now creates all beep wave files and debugging logs etc in the user's temp directory, rather than its own. This does mean though now that if you wish to look at a debug file, they are now in the temp directory named as nvda_debug.log and nvda_stderr.log. Also NVDA now better handles the situation where the configuration file (nvda.ini) can not be saved because of a read-only file system.


Changes since revision 348:
*Improved responsiveness and accuracy of navigating around Outlook Express message edit controls and Internet Explorer edit controls.
*The names of email fields in Outlook Express like To, CC, subject are all reported correctly when moving between them.
 *Page down in internet Explorer and Mozilla virtualBuffers now works properly, rather than moving to the bottom of the document.
*Some dialog box windows, which weren't being announced as dialogs are now announcing properly. Namely ones that use the TWizardForm class (such as Free Ino setup).
*More improvements to reading menus plus making sure that the focus is properly announced when leaving them. The new XP start menu seems to read ok now, previously some things wouldn't read unless you went in and out of one of the sub-menus.
*Fixed a bug with edit controls where lines could appear garbled or they could also just cause NVDA to freeze.
*Improved the loading of NVDA when run off a USB key. It now should start talking much earlier, while loading what it has to.
  *AppModules (for MS Word, Excel, Miranda, Outlook Express etc) now should load properly in Windows 2000.
*Support for MS Word and MS Excel should load much more quicker. previously there was a possibility  that it could take up to a minute to generate needed files.
*Some unneeded files are no longer included in the binary package.
*Added basic support for the display on the Windows calculator. If its value changes it will be announced.
*If the control which has focus suddenly hides or disappears, NVDA will either try to correct the focus or announce that it has lost focus. An example of where this happens is in the repare dialog for a network connection.
*The title of a dos window is no longer announced each time the user runs a command with in the window.
*NVDA now recognizes TRichEdit windows properly as rich edit controls which makes them accessible.
*The dialogs for changing the synthesizer and the voice no longer cause NVDA to crash.
*Internet Explorer: Fixed a few little bugs where doing something too quickly, or before a virtualBuffer had completely loaded, would cause an error.
*Image maps links in Mozilla Gecko virtualBuffers are now shown
*Improved support for links in dialog boxes (in Windows Vista).
*Fixed a spelling error in a message to do with not being able to find the status bar.
*Majorly improved performence when navigating in a rich edit control (such as in Wordpad). Moving with the cursor is much more responsive, and sayAll doesn't seem to crash any more. 
*Redesigned the exit dialog to contain ok and cancel buttons, rather than yes and no buttons. The default is now ok which means you can just press enter to exit, and the escape key now works to get rid of the dialog with out exiting.
 *Many internal changes which improve the way support for specific applications can be written, plus a few changes to try and improve memory leaks.


Changes since revision 316:
*Support for edit fields and text chat log in Skype.
*Internet Explorer (MSHTML) virtualBuffers now render IFrames (which means that user accounts in control panel now shows more of its content).
*Some more work to stop dialogs crashing (possibly) and protected against synths giving bad values, or complaining about bad values.
 *Fixed bug where combo boxes and sliders etc were speaking their value twice when it changed.
*Support for NVDA to fall back to using normal edit control support on a rich edit control that fails to work properly (example: log in fileZilla).
*Made sure that graphics with no label, but that are part of a link, are rendered in Mozilla Gecko virtualBuffers.
*Now use a different way of telling the difference between a link and an anchor tag in Mozilla Gecko virtualBuffers. Now anchor tags are not rendered if they are not supposed to be, but all normal links definitly are now.
*Renamed some of the scripts for better readability with in keyboard help mode (insert+1)
*Increased the size of the NVDA interface window so that more text can fit on a line.
*Added version and copyright info to the top of the built-in quick-start document.
*Improved sayAll for MS Word tables.
*Added support for the Miranda IM contact list. The code is a little dojy, but it seems to work ok on the systems tested so far. 
*Fixed the bug where listViews sometimes were reporting the wrong number of items (example: windows explorer details view, and Outlook Express message list)
*Added language support for Brazilian Portuguese, translations by Cleverson Casarin Uliana  
*Added language support for Finnish, translations by  Jani Kinnunen
*Added a language combo box to the user interface settings dialog on the preferences menu. Here you can choose between the available languages that NVDA will use to represent the interface, and screen reader messages. For all changes to take affect, you will need to restart NVDA.
*Hopefully stopped all freezes and crashes when doing sayAll in MS Word.
*Fixed freezes and crashes when reading some dialogs in MS Word such as Find and Replace, and Spelling and Gramma.
*SayAll now reads by sentence in Rich edit controls, MS Word documents, and Outlook Express message edit controls. This should make reading a little more fluent with some synths.
*Fix bugs in Outlook express and internet explorer edit controls where selecting text would not speak, or sayAll would fail to work. Although now arrowing by line may be a touch slower, all the standard text navigation functions have now been implemented properly, rather than just overiding some of the high-level scripts.
*Fixed up the support for entering and exiting menus. Now the name of a menu is spoken when entering it, and when leaving a menu the focus is placed properly back where it should be. NVDA also reports "menu closed" when leaving a menu.

Changes since revision 315:
*Fixed bug where NVDA would not notify of a foreground change sometimes after leaving a menu (example: shutdown or control pannel in the start menu).
*Added a script to read the foreground window and its descendants (useful for reading the contents of dialog boxes). This is bound to the key insert+b.
*Fixed a bug where some web pages in Mozilla Gecko windows would freeze NVDA when being loaded (example: www.expedia.com/). 
*Made sure that the old Viavoice driver was not being included in the packaging of the binary distribution. This hopefully will stop the Synthesizer dialog crashing NVDA on some systems.
 
Changes since revision 297:
*Documents in Mozilla Gecko now handle bullets and numbering of list items better. Previously a bullet would force a list item to sometimes be over two lines.
*Configuration dialog boxes have been added for voice settings, mouse settings, keyboard echo and object presentation. All of these settings can be changed in realtime, but if the dialog box is canceled, they go back to their origional values.
*Improved the reading of objects under the mouse more so that hopefully NVDA will not freeze if using the mouse to close a window.
*Improved responsiveness and memory management in some parts of NVDA. Most noticeably NVDA no longer will sometimes freeze up for a second or two when closing some applications.
*Progress bars in Mozilla Gecko windows now have the ability to beep on updating their values (like standard Windows progress bars)
*When leaving the menu bar or context menu of an application, NVDA now moves back to the correct place of focus and reports it.
*Removed the sapi4 driver because it was causing trouble on a lot of systems, plus it has to be rewritten to solve some problems to do with threading. Now NVDA only supports sapi5.
*Added a say 'cap' before capitals option to NVDA. When on (check the checkbox in voice settings) the word 'cap' will be prepended to any single capital letter spoken. This means either when typing a capital letter with sayTypedCharacters on, or when arrowing on to a capital letter. This was added because some synthesizers may not support pitch and therefore have no way of denoting capital letters.
*Caps lock and Num lock now speak when being turned on and off.
*NVDA no longer hides its user interface on startup by default. If you want it to hide by default, check the "Hide user interface on startup" checkbox in the User Interface settings dialog on the preferences menu.
*Added an option to automatically save the current configuration on exit. (Found in the User Interface settings dialog)
*The NVDA interface now contains a navigatable text control in the main part of its window, which contains a quick-start document explaining how the User interface works, and also documents many useful NVDA key strokes.
*Added a script to report the title of the active window (insert+t). Like speak title in many other screen readers.
*The navigator where am I script (insert+numpadAdd) now starts from the object that is a parent to the current navigator object, rather than starting from the actual current navigator object. This is to make it quicker to find out where you are since you can already report the current navigator object with insert+numpad5. The script now also says the word 'in' before each object to separate the objects more clearly.
*Added a script to report the dimentions and location (in pixles)of the current navigator object (shift+insert+numpad5) 

Changes since revision 293:
*Graphics in Mozilla Gecko virtualBuffers are now ignored if they do not have a title / alt attribute.
*Page up and page down in rich edit documents now speak the line that they move to.

Changes since revision 287:
*Support for pages with dynamic content in Mozilla Gekco applications is now complete. Make sure that updateContentDynamically (in the virtualBuffers section of nvda.ini) is set to true for this all to work.
NVDA does not yet automaticlaly read changes, but it does beep when things are being updated. you can arrow around to see what has changed.
*Reading of new text in dos console windows is again much improved.
*NVDA no longer crashes when pressing control+c in dos console windows.
*the speed in which NVDA Loads documents in mozilla gecko windows (such as in Firefox) is now more than doubled.
Example: it used to take around 8 seconds to load www.anz.com but now it takes only 3.
*insert+s used to turn speech on and off, but now it toggles between 3 speech modes: talk, beeps and off.
Talk is just normal speech, off is off, but beeps, is an idea that came from the Dos screen reader, ASAP. This mode plays a 5ms 10000HZ tone (very high and very short) each time an item of speech is supposed to happen. It is very responsive, and it allows you to deal with the situation when you are doing something that is constantly changing the screen, as in millions of files are scrolling up a dos console, or perhaps you are running a setup program that is constantly telling you what file it is copying etc. If you switch to the  beeps speech mode, you only have to wait until the flood of beeps stop and you know the task is finished. This is much faster than having to keep pressing control, or waiting for all the speech to finish.
*Made the pitch of the beeps speech mode configurable through beepsSpeechModePitch, in the speech section of nvda.ini.

Changes since revision 164:
*Sound files are used instead of PC speaker beeps to denote events in NVDA such as startup, exit, error and crash.
*Mouse shape changes are now reported if set to do so.
*Fixed some bugs in the sapi5 driver, making it more responsive, and less likely to not stop speaking when asked to.
*Objects that do not have a specific type (client objects) are now reported as "window".
*beeps are now used to communicate the percentage of a progress bar as it goes up (example: copying a large amount of data in windows explorer, or loading a large web page in internet explorer).
*group box names are now reported when an object with the focus is in one. (Example: settings buttons, advanced tab, system properties dialog, control panel). 
*NVDA can now read formatting changes in documents whilst reading with say all.
*A review say all, that doesn't use the system caret, but only the NVDA review cursor, can be started with the numpad Plus key. This sayAll is useful in dos consoles and other places that may not have a system caret.
*If your synthesizer is set to "auto" in nvda.ini (which it now is by default), NVDA will search for the first available synthesizer. Currently it looks for sapi5 and then sapi4.
*Fixed some crashes in MS Office applications
*In Microsoft Word, the row and column numbers of the current cell are spoken after the entering table message. Previously they were spoken before.
*If an object supports it, you can now review it with the numpad by line, word or character when you navigate to it with the insert numpad commands. Previously you could only review the object with focus.
*All objects now let their name, value and description be reviewed with the numberpad keys if the object doesn't have a specific text buffer. Example: arrowing to a list item in windows explorer and then using the numpad keys lets you review the spelling of the file name.
*Static text objects are now reviewable. This means it is now possible to review dialog text such as in the NBDA About dialog box. Just Navigate to the static text with the insert numpad commands and use the numpad keys to read it. 
*When moving focus to a list, the active list item now always gets spoken. (If there is no active list item, then it will say at least how many items are in the list, most of the time this is 0). Previously some lists spoke the active item, some didn't. 
*You can now move the mouse pointer to the current navigator object position with insert+numpadDivide. Also you can move the current Navigator object to the mouse pointer with insert+numpadMultiply.
*Fixed a bug that stopped internet explorer reading when pressing tab
*Links no longer say the URL as their value. They also now say "visited link" for visited links.
*Greatly improved the internet explorer virtualBuffer by having the type of object (link, heading, list) spoken as you arrow on to it, but not having it actually written physically in the buffer. So if you arrow to a link, you can straight away arrow through its name, rather than arrowing across l i n k first. 
*Frames are now supported in Internet Explorer.
*Edit fields in Internet Explorer forms are now able to be navigated with the cursor.
*It is now possible to edit and navigate in editable internet explorer windows (example: Outlook Express new message window). A part from a few controls which may not properly report their names, this makes Outlook Express now usable for both reading and writing messages.
*It is now possible to read web pages in Mozilla Firefox and emails in Mozilla Thunderbird. However, editing emails and navigating edit fields is not yet supported.
*Fixed bug where the default configuration had alignment=Always in the documentFormatting section. It is now Never. Please edit your nvda.ini to reflect this change if in deed your file was generated when this bug existed).
*Made MS Word and MS Excel slightly more responsive by using pre-generated com interface python code rather than querying the com interfaces each time a property or method is accessed. 
*Made NVDA over all much more responsive (especially in edit fields such as an address bar)
*Fixed bug where tooltips and help balloons were not speaking
*Fixed up some bugs in mouse tracking (NVDA should now report objects as the mouse moves over them).
*Reporting the object under the mouse can be turned off or on by insert+m.
*Added key echo scripts:
-insert+2 toggle speak typed characters
-insert+3 toggle speak typed words
-insert+4 toggle speak command keys
These scripts also make sure they say * when typing in edit fields with the protected state set (e.g. password fields).
*Fixed handling of crashes so that if the screen reader core dies, it should take the GUI down with it
*Added a voice dialog on the preferences menu
*The synthesizer dialog now only shows synthesizers currently found on your system. It also now has a longer description for each synth (including the name of the dll or com interface it uses)
*Added a save configuration to the NVDA menu. This writes the current config to nvda.ini, previously this was done automatically on exit. However, nvda.in is written to disc also once NVDA has been started successfully.
*Added a 'revert to saved configuration' command to the NVDA menu. This reloads the configuration from nvda.ini and sets up the speech etc to reflect the configuration. 
*Insert+q now properly activates the exit message dialog box, saying yes will exit NVDA completely.
*NVDA now starts with its window completely hidden (not even just minimized). You now need to press insert+n to bring it up, and press alt+f4 to make it go away. 
*The NVDA window when shown should be now centered in the middle of the screen and is 300 by 300 pixels in size. 
*Improved the internal structure of NVDA objects and virtualBuffers and made NVDA less dependent on MSAA. (NVDA still needs MSAA for most things, but now it is much easier for support for other accessibility APIs to be designed).
*Removed the IBM Viavoice synth driver due to licencing restrictions 

Changes since revision 82:
*Added support for the automatic speaking of font, style, page number etc of documents.
*Fixed many small bugs to do with navigating documents by character, word and line.
*Added support for Microsoft Word:
-Navigating by character, word and line
-Finding out current font, page number, style, whether you are in a table
*Added support for Microsoft Excel:
-Navigating around cells
-Finding out current font, coordinates, whether it has a formular
*Much improved support for dos console windows:
-Fixed bug that would crash NVDA when dos console windows close
-More responsive reading of new text (now watches for MSAA console events rather than checking over and over until it changes)
-No longer speaks new text if the new text is a character that the user has just typed
*Re-written virtualBuffer support:
-Now you can use the normal arrow keys to navigate like an edit field
-insert+space changes to focusInteractionMode so that key presses such as the arrows go straight through to the object with focus. (Used with Internet Explore to interact with certain form fields).
*Support for Internet Explorer document windows:
-Works both in and out of Internet Explorer itself (example: html messages in outlook express)
-Gives you the ability to navigate the document with the arrows (character, word and line)
-Detects links, form fields, headings etc.
*A new synth driver for IBM Viavoice has been added as "viavoice" (Works with versions that hav ibmeci50.dll).
*Improved sapi5 synth driver to include changing the voice
*When reading by character, pitch of speech goes up to denote capital letters if the synth supports it
*Improved overall responsivness by implementing MSAA support directly in to NVDA rather than using the pyAA (python Active Accessibility) library
*Added a keyboard help mode (insert+1)
*Included some minimal documentation in to the stand alone version of NVDA when it is built
*Added the ability for appModules to register and unregister their own NVDA objects and virtual Buffer objects
*Synth drivers now are stored in the synthDrivers directory, rather than in the base directory
*Added a toggle speech script (insert+s) to temporarily turn off speech
*Improved text processing before sending it to the synth so that words that have entirely capitalized sections such as in "NVDAObjects" are read correctly. Also so it handles the reading of words ending in numbers properly.
*Added support for reading plaine/rich text messages in outlook Express. (Together with the internet explorer support for HTML messages, this means all messages should be able to be read).
 *NVDA now by default asks the operating system for the names of control roles and states, but the defaults can be replaced in the NVDA dictionaries
*A say all script has been added for edit fields and documents (insert+downArrow)
*Increase and decrease rate scripts (insert+pageUp and insert+pageDown) have been added.
*The GUI has been changed so that there is an NVDA window. If closed, NVDA will exit. It also has a menu bar with menus to control NVDA:
-NVDA menu, exit
-Preferences menu, synthesizer...
-Help menu, about...
